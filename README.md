Timesheet for the European Commission co-financed projects.

The project goal is the creation of a script (R Markdown) for generating a .pdf file including timesheets on the fly out of a MS Excel file in which are reported, e.g., the monthly worked hours, the hours worked on each EC co-funded project, etc.

The output document is based on the template fitting the guidelines for Horizon 2020, the financial instrument implementing the Innovation Union, a Europe 2020 flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe's global competitiveness.
